# Database Testing with PostgreSQL and Python
This repository contains a series of test cases designed to validate various functionalities of a PostgreSQL database using Python. Each test case aims to ensure the integrity and reliability of user data management within the database.
## Overview
This project tests essential database operations using PostgreSQL and Python, focusing on user data management. Each test case checks specific conditions and constraints to ensure the database's performance and reliability.
## Test Cases
1. [**Query All Data from Database**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%201): To verify that all user data present in the users table can be successfully queried.
2. [**Retrieve User Information**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%202): Ensure that user details can be fetched accurately from the database.
3. [**Finding Users with NULL Email**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%203): Check for users who have not provided an email address.
4. [**Check for Duplicate USER IDs**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%204): Verify that unique constraints on user IDs are enforced.
5. [**Update User Email**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%205): Test the functionality of updating a user's email address.
6. [**Finding Invalid Statuses**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%206): Ensure that only valid user statuses are allowed.
7. [**Violates Foreign Key Restraint**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%207): Confirm that attempting to delete a user with related records raises an appropriate error.
8. [**Query Execution Time**](https://github.com/Kolade31/Database-Testing-with-PostgreSQL-and-Python-/tree/main/Test%20Case%208): Measure the execution time of various queries to ensure performance standards are met.
