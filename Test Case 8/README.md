# Test Case 8: Query Execution Time
## Objective
To verify that the execution time of a specific query does not exceed a predefined threshold, ensuring performance standards are met.
## Pre-requisites
- The users table must be populated with a sufficient number of records to properly test query performance.
- PostgreSQL database must be running.
- Python environment with SQLAlchemy installed.
## Test Steps
1. Establish Database Connection:
- Connect to the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
2. Define the Query:
- Create a SQL query that needs to be tested for execution time. For example, retrieving all users.
3. Set Expected Execution Time Threshold:
- Define an acceptable maximum execution time (e.g., 5000 milliseconds).
4. Measure Execution Time:
- Use Python's time module to measure the execution time of the query.
5. Validate Execution Time Against Threshold:
- Check if the measured execution time is less than or equal to the predefined threshold.
## Expected Result
The execution time of the query should be less than or equal to the defined threshold (e.g., 5000 milliseconds).
## Status
PASS
## Actual Result
The execution time of the query was less than defined threshold.
## Post-conditions
Ensure the database remains unchanged after the test execution.
## Cleanup
Close the database connection.
